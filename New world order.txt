Cheers to everyone who does their own research.
In the age of information ,ignorance is a choice.
I mean, look at this. Look at it! A world built on fantasy.
Synthetic emotions in the form of pills. Psychological warfare in the form of advertising. Mind-altering chemicals in the form of food . Brainwashing seminars in the form of media .
Controlled isolated bubbles in the form of social networks. 
We live in branded houses trademarked by corporations built on bipolar numbers jumping up and down on digital displays, hypnotizing us into the biggest slumber mankind has ever seen.
You have to dig pretty deep, before you can find anything real. We live in a world of bullshit ,a world you have lived in for far too long .
So basically what I’m trying to say is you can’t believe everything you read or see, learn to think for yourself.
I end by quoting Plato “ Those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood , let alone believed by the masses “. 

N/B: We are spiritual people ,many of you have forgotten and became religious. 
Never derail from the ethics and norms of your ancestors.
